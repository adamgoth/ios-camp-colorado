# Camp Colorado
In Development

## What it is
An app for discovering campsites. This app will show your location on a map along with a pin for all Colorado campsites. Selecting a pin will tell you how far you are from that campsite (in miles). Clicking the info button for a campsite will take you the detail view for that campsite. In this detail view, you will find campsite details such as latitude and longitude, the nearest town, the number of campsites, phone number, and web address, along with user-submitted reviews, ratings, and photographs.
